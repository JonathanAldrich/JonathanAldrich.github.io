How Much Do Professors Work, and How Do They Spend Their Time? A Personal Perspective
=====================================================================================

Recently, I heard that among the Software Engineering Ph.D. students at CMU, there is an impression that "The parameter 'required effort to be above average in my profession' has annoyingly high values for tenure-track jobs. Committing to this level of effort for decades seems to be a major deterrent" for students going into academia.

This concern is justified in the sense that I think a lot of professors do put in a lot of hours.  But I don't think it's correct to conclude that this is
either universal or necessary.  A particularly good article on this issue was written by Radhika Nagpal at Harvard:

[The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/)

Here's my own perspective, based on how I spent my time in the last academic year, August 2016-July 2017.
I started tracking my time two years ago, enabling me to answer this question better than I used to be able to.  Here's a summary:

I spent about 2233 hours working, which is about 49 hours per nominal
work week, leaving reasonable time for vacations (there are about 45.5
nominal work weeks in the year if you take 52 weeks and subtract the
average American worker's vacation, holiday, and sick days).  I broke
this down as follows:

* 26% Advising 
* 15% Teaching
* 15% Raising money and managing funded projects
* 13% Professional (e.g. professional meetings, reading papers that I am not reviewing)
* 12% Service to Carnegie Mellon, my university
* 11% Service to the external community
* 6% [Wyvern](https://github.com/wyvernlang/wyvern/wiki/Wyvern:-A-Language-for-Usable-Design-Driven-Assurance) (my "keystone" project if you will - this is time not spent specifically advising)
* 2% Other (e.g. organization, non-advising/non-Wyvern research)

The above is reasonably close to "time on task" - e.g. if I spend 15 minutes reading a NYT article about some politician's latest antics, I don't include that time in my records.

What do I personally conclude from this data?

* I work hard, but it isn't crazy.  I have time for vacations and
family, though sometimes not as much as I would like.  Radhika's
article implies she targets around 50 hours/week for work weeks; she
seems reasonably well-adjusted, and I'm close to that.  Lots of people
in industry work more.

* The teaching number is low.  In part that is because I taught classes where it was possible to deliver a course in less time, but that won't be the case every year.  Thus, this percentage will likely be higher in other years.  I'd actually like to spend more time teaching so as to provide a better learning experience to students, and also to invest in some longer-term projects such as converting my program analysis course notes into a textbook.

* I think a lot of faculty (maybe especially at places like CMU?) spend even more than 15% of their time chasing funding, but spending over 7 hours/week is too much for me.  The main reason is that I find many parts of raising money to be misery-inducing, and I need to reduce the time spent on it to maintain my sanity.  Of course, I have to raise some money if I want to advise students--one of my favorite activities.  I'm working on being more efficient with fundraising, choosing funding sources that trigger less misery, and moving gradually towards a modestly smaller research group in which I will invest more of my time per student (which I would like to do for other reasons anyway!)

* The service numbers are perhaps a bit high, but not too far off.  This year, I organized the OOPSLA PC, which was a big community service task.  I probably won't run another top-tier PC for a few years, but I will still need to do my bit for the community in other ways.  Closer to home, I run the Software Engineering Ph.D. program at CMU, which is a relatively big local commitment.  Despite the workload, I'm quite happy to keep doing this, as I find it highly personally rewarding--more than average for service tasks, and again, of course, we all need to do our part.

One of the lessons I've learned is to be strategic about my time,
something I definitely wasn't doing when I first started as a
professor.  Tracking my time helps with that, even though there is
some overhead (I fill in boxes on an online app, [Bubbletimer](http://bubbletimer.com/)) because
it reminds me to think about what I am doing.  It gives me a good
reason to say "no" to good (but optional) things in areas where I am
already spending too much time.  It also encourages me to prioritize:
maximizing long-term impact and fun (for research, education, or
service) or money (for grants) while minimizing time spent and "pain
factor."  As a result, I think I am actually working a bit less than I
did early in my career (though I wasn't tracking my time then so it's
hard to be sure) but I think I'm having at least as much impact as I
did then, mostly because I'm working smarter.

Overall, although it's not perfect, I'm reasonably happy with the way I'm spending my time, which is actually a bit better than it was the year before (I can dig up those numbers if anyone's interested).  What I'd really like to do is divide a nominal 40-hour workweek into about 35% research/advising, 25% teaching, 20% service, 10% professional growth, and 10% funding--then spend a few additional hours each week on "extra" personally rewarding projects (generally in the "Professional" and "Wyvern" categories above).  We'll see how the coming year goes! :)

Getting back to the original issue raised by our graduate students...careers take lots of different forms, and your mileage may vary, but I
think academia has a lot going for it if you manage things the right
way.  I haven't completely nailed the "right way" for me, but I think I'm getting closer to it.
The two best things about my job are working with
students and getting to work on the problems I find most interesting.
To get to do that and still have a reasonably scoped job is pretty cool!
