Should we consolidate SIGPLAN conferences?  If so, how?
=======================================================

*"Never let a good crisis go to waste."* - attributed to Winston Churchill

People leading SIGPLAN and its conferences have been asking what SIGPLAN should do post-COVID.  Do we go back to business as usual, with 4 major in-person events per year with scattered smaller events in the community?  Or should we take this interruption, and what we have learned about online conferences, to do something different?

Here are some issues people are thinking about, and a perspective on each.

Conference Consolidation and Solidfying Hierarchy
--------------------------------------------------

We publish in a lot of venues; in addition to our premier conferences, there are many smaller events.  Regretably, conference ratings such as Google Scholar's h5 indexes as well as human and automated approaches such as CORE and CS Rankings have widened the perceived differences in quality among these venues; I have heard departments urge faculty to submit primarily to top conferences to enhance the department's CS Ranking, for example.  As a consequence, submissions have been increasing at the top venues and decreasing everywhere else.  Maybe this is good in some ways, as papers published in the top conferences get more visibility and we see each other there.  But it is also bad in some ways, as the specialized venues are often incubators for work that can't be published elsewhere.  There is a problem with the direction we are going; consolidation seems almost inevitable, but how can we address what we lose due to that consolidation?  One possibility is trying to form "big tent" venues that will have high prestige, but build in mechanisms to ensure those tents will include papers that so far have been fostered mainly by more specialized venues.

In-Person Travel
----------------

Many people want to meet in person with international colleagues.  But there are two challenges.  First, SIGPLAN has 4 premier conferences, and it's hard to go to all of them, so we don't see all our colleagues every year.  Second, we are all becoming more aware of the need to reduce carbon emissions, so it's better to take fewer trips and get more out of them.  This suggests a strategy of moving some conferences online permanently, and consolidate in-person conferences as much as possible.  If we did this, our community might look more like HCI or SE, which each have a clearly identifiable dominant international conference (CHI and ICSE, respectively).

Submission Timing
-----------------
 
It's nice to have 4 deadlines around the year for major SIGPLAN conferences, because work matures at different times, and because timely resubmission becomes possible after fixing issues with a paper identified by reviewers.  But there are known models for fixing this issue: journal-first submission (e.g. as in TOPLAS submission, with later presentation in a SIGPLAN conference) and multiple deadlines (e.g. as the Programming conference/journal hybrid does).  For SIGPLAN, the TOPLAS option is already in place, and I would personally be pretty happy with that.  If there are those who aren't, a Programming-style solution, where committee members agree to be on a conference committee for a year, with 3 different submission windows, might be a good alternative.
 
Conference Homes for Different Areas
------------------------------------

The hardest thing about consolidating SIGPLAN conferences would be that they have unique personalities.  Our conferences are homes that nuture particular subcommunities, and pay attention to particular problems and styles of scientific work.  Our field is stronger because PLDI nurtures PL theory and connections with math; because PLDI nutures work on compilers and performance; because ICFP nutures work in functional programming; and because OOPSLA nutures research on OO as well as connections with industry and software engineering.  This problem becomes more acute when you also consider specialized venues like GPCE, a conference colocated with OOPSLA at SPLASH.

But different conferences are not the only way to solve this problem.  The CHI conference has 15 topical subcommittees, each with its own chairs and program subcommittee.  Authors select the subcommittee best suited to their work, and can list two if necessary.  There is no hierarchy among subcommittees; which subcommittee was selected is not obvious in the proceedings or prrgram.  We could adopt a similar solution to ensure that papers in the wide variety of areas we publish retain good homes.  In practice, we would have more than 4 subcommittees, as we could intentionally design the areas rather than just take the ones that have naturally evolved into the current ICFP/OOPSLA/PLDI/POPL.  As an example, one such area might be metaprogramming and generative computing.


Proposal: A SIGPLAN Conference
------------------------------

I propose that we create one international SIGPLAN conference, meeting in-person annually, with remote participation options provided as best we can.  SIGPLAN would replace ICFP, OOPSLA, PLDI, and POPL, and it would host a wide variety of specialized workshops.  The first one could be held in June/July 2022 (benefiting from summer academic break in the northern hemisphere, while avoiding August holidays) by which time we can hope COVID would be well under control.  All other SIGPLAN-sponsored conferences would be held virtually, perhaps with narrow exceptions for highly local conferences.  SIGPLAN papers would be published in PACMPL, as ICFP/OOPSLA/POPL papers are today.  The PC would have subcommittees covering communities represented across SIGPLAN, as way of retaining diversity in the field; we would look to CHI for organizational inspiration.  SIGPLAN would accept submissions throughout the year, with a late fall deadline for papers expected to be presented in any given year's conference.  TOPLAS to SIGPLAN would be one option for submission throughout the year, but having a standing committee would be a valuable addition to consider.  The new conference would target publishing at least as many papers annually as the four major SIGPLAN conferences currently do when combined, and maintaining an acceptance rate that remains selective yet, for inclusivity, is at or above the average of those four conferences.

Alternatives
------------

What are the major alternatives?  We could make all conferences virtual; that would solve the climate problem, but I don't believe our community is ready to give up in-person, international events.  The most likely alternative is the status quo, but that is almost certainly worse for the climate than my proposal, and it ignores the problems of consolidation squeezing out the diversity of work in our field.  A SIGPLAN multiconference without the reviewing reforms above would make the consolidation/loss of area homes and submission timing problems worse.

Let's Work Together
-------------------

Please consider the problems outlined above.  If you are convinced, upon reflection, that they are real, consider this proposal as a solution that, while undoubtedly imperfect, could improve on the status quo in multiple dimensions.  If you'd like to work together on fleshing out this proposal and making it happen, let me know, and I'll convene a group to work on it.
