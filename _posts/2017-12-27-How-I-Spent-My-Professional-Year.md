How I Spent My Professional Year
================================

Recently, I heard that among the students at CMU, there is an impression that 'The parameter "required effort to be above average in my profession" has annoyingly high values for tenure-track jobs. Committing to this level of effort for decades seems to be a major deterrent' for students going into academia.

This concern is justified in the sense that I think a lot of professors do put in a lot of ours.  But I don't think it's correct to conclude that this is
either universal or necessary.  A particularly good article on this issue was written by Radhika Nagpal at Harvard:

[The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/)

Here's my own perspective--in particular, how I spent my time in the last academic year, August 2016-July 2017.
I started tracking my time two years ago.  Here's a
summary of the data:

I spent about 2233 hours working, which is about 49 hours per nominal
work week, leaving reasonable time for vacations (there are about 45.5
nominal work weeks in the year if you take 52 weeks and subtract the
average American worker's vacation, holiday, and sick days).  I broke
this down as follows:

* Advising 26%
* External service 11%
* Raising money and managing funded projects 15%
* Wyvern (my "keystone" project if you will) 6%
* CMU service 12%
* Teaching 15%
* Professional 13%
* Other (organization, misc. research) 2%

What do I personally conclude from this data?

* I work hard, but it isn't crazy.  I have time for vacations and
family, though sometimes not as much as I would like.  Radhika's
article implies she targets around 50 hours/week for work weeks; she
seems reasonably well-adjusted, and I'm close to that.  Lots of people
in industry work more.  I might increase it once my kids are out of
the house, but only if it's too much fun to stay away! :)

* The balance is OK (and better than it was the year before--I can
dig up those numbers if anyone really wants to know).  I would
definitely like to spend considerably more time teaching (to increase
the quality level of my course delivery, and invest in things like
writing a textbook) and considerably less time on raising money (but
of course to do one of my favorite tasks, advising, I have to do some
of this).  I would like to spend a little less time on service (e.g. I
organized the OOPSLA PC in 2017, and running the SE Ph.D. program is
one of the bigger--but also most fun--CMU service tasks), but I
probably can't realistically go much below 8-10% of my time each for
CMU and for the broader community and still shoulder my share of the
load.

* One of the lessons I've learned is to be strategic about my time,
something I definitely wasn't doing when I first started as a
professor.  Tracking my time helps with that, even though there is
some overhead (I fill in boxes on an online app, Bubbletimer) because
it reminds me to think about what I am doing.  It gives me a good
reason to say "no" to good but optional things in areas where I am
already spending too much time.  It also encourages me to prioritize:
maximizing long-term impact and fun (for research, education, or
service) or money (for grants) while minimizing time spent and "pain
factor."  As a result, I think I am actually working a bit less than I
did early in my career (though I wasn't tracking my time then so it's
hard to be sure) but I think I'm having at least as much impact as I
did then, mostly because I'm working smarter.

Careers take lots of different forms, and your mileage may vary, but I
think academia has a lot going for it if you manage things the right
way.  The two best things, from my point of view, are working with
students and getting to work on the problems I find most interesting.
